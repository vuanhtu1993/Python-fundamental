# Gradient Descent Example for Linear Regression

This example project demonstrates how the gradient descent algorithm may be used to solve a linear regression problem. A more detailed description of this example can be found <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/">here </a>.

## Code Requirements

The example code is in Python (version 2.6 or higher will work). The only other requirement is NumPy.

## Description

This code demonstrates how a gradient descent search may be used to solve the linear regression problem of fitting a line to a set of points. In this problem, we wish to model a set of points using a line. The line model is defined by two parameters - the line's slope m, and y-intercept b. Gradient descent attemps to find the best values for these parameters, subject to an error function.

The code contains a main function called run. This function defines a set of parameters used in the gradient descent algorithm including an initial guess of the line slope and y-intercept, the learning rate to use, and the number of iterations to run gradient descent for.

## Dependencies
* numpy
Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Execution

Just run ``python gradient_descent.py`` to see the results:

   ```
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
   ```
